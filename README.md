# âœˆ Musafer Project

**Musafer** is a platform that connects **travelers** with **residents** in their destination country.  
The idea is simple: when a traveler has extra space in their luggage, they can help carry items requested by residents â€” saving time, reducing shipping costs, and fostering community connections.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Idea
- A **resident** can post a request for an item they need from another country.
- A **traveler** can check available requests for their destination and offer to carry the item if they have space in their luggage.
- Both parties can communicate through the platform to arrange delivery.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- ðŸ‘¤ **User Roles:** Traveler / Resident.
- ðŸ“¦ **Request Posting:** Residents can add item details, size, and weight.
- ðŸ§³ **Luggage Space Matching:** Travelers can see requests that match their available space.
- ðŸ’¬ **Messaging System:** Built-in chat for easy coordination.
- ðŸ“± **Responsive Design:** Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
